# Todo list for ethereum blockchain

This is my first Solidity and dApp learning project.

- read only todo items created by you
- mark todo item as done and receive your deposit back

## Todo

- update list when new item created or marked as done
- keep state in redux store (or useReducer)
- react to network and account changes
- deploy contract to test network and publish frontend to netlify
